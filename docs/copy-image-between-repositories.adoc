= Copy an Image Between Registries

This should not be rocket science right? Well, it is. And there are multiple ways to go about it.
There are various tools that will copy an image between registries, including Google's link:https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/doc/crane.md[crane], RedHat's link:https://github.com/containers/skopeo[skopeo], link:https://github.com/regclient/regclient[regclient], but also `docker buildx`.

I've tried multiple approaches, as you can see from the history if this repo, but there are two that worked like a charm for me: `regclient` and `docker buildx`.

We'll go the difficult path and use two secure Amazon ECR Repos. This means we need another tool to store credentials, the link:https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper[amazon-ecr-credential-helper]

== Set up

IMPORTANT: on macOS the `oskeychain` gets in the middle and "steals" your Docker tokens(all in the name of security of course), so you have to put them in the `~/.docker/config.json` file yourself.

[source, shell]
----
rm -rf ~/.docker/config.json

AWS_ACCOUNT=..
REGION=..
REPO_SRC=${AWS_ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.${REGION}.amazonaws.com
echo "... authenticate to source repo ..."
aws ecr get-login-password --region ${REGION} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "${AWS_ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.${REGION}.amazonaws.com"

# edit the ~/.docker/config.json manually and replace 'osxkeychain' with 'desktop'

AWS_ACCOUNT_OTHER=...
REGION_OTHER=us-east-1
REPO_DEST=${AWS_ACCOUNT_OTHER}.dkr.ecr.${REGION_OTHER}.amazonaws.com
echo "... authenticate to destination repo ..."
aws ecr get-login-password --region ${REGION_OTHER} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "${AWS_ACCOUNT_OTHER}.dkr.ecr.${REGION_OTHER}.amazonaws.com"


cat ~/.docker/config.json  # should return something like

{
  "auths": {
    "{AWS_ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.{REGION}.amazonaws.com": {},
    "{AWS_ACCOUNT_OTHER}.dkr.ecr.{REGION_OTHER}.amazonaws.com": {}
  },
  "credsStore": "desktop",
  "currentContext": "desktop-linux",
  "plugins": {
    "-x-cli-hints": {
      "enabled": "true"
    }
  }
}

== Using `docker buildx`

TIP: The `OLD_TAG` is the tag for the manifest created with Podman. `NEW_TAG` is the tag pointing at the repository where you want to copy the multi-arch image.

[source, shell]
----
IMAGE_NAME=boot-demo
OLD_TAG="${AWS_ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.${REGION}.amazonaws.com/${IMAGE_NAME}:1.0"
NEW_TAG="${AWS_ACCOUNT_OTHER}.dkr.ecr.${REGION_OTHER}.amazonaws.com/${IMAGE_NAME}:1.0-1708080898"

docker buildx imagetools create --tag "$NEW_TAG" "$OLD_TAG"

# inspect the manifest
docker manifest inspect "${AWS_ACCOUNT_OTHER}.dkr.ecr.${REGION_OTHER}.amazonaws.com/${IMAGE_NAME}:1.0-1708080898"
docker manifest inspect "${AWS_ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.${REGION}.amazonaws.com/${IMAGE_NAME}:1.0"
----

== Using `docker regclient`

`regclient` is a set of utilitties, the one we use is `regctl`. The `regctl` utility will import credentials from the docker logins stored in `$HOME/.docker/config.json` and trust certificates loaded in `/etc/docker/certs.d/$registry/*.crt`. Thus, it will work like a charm, with the Docker setup.

[source, shell]
----
brew install regclient # or use a way specific to your system

OLD_TAG="${AWS_ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.${REGION}.amazonaws.com/${IMAGE_NAME}:1.0"
NEW_TAG="${AWS_ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.${REGION_OTHER}.amazonaws.com/${IMAGE_NAME}:1.0-1708080898"

regctl image copy "${OLD_TAG}" "${NEW_TAG}"
# inspect the manifest
docker manifest inspect "${AWS_ACCOUNT_OTHER}.dkr.ecr.${REGION_OTHER}.amazonaws.com/${IMAGE_NAME}:1.0-1708080898"
docker manifest inspect "${AWS_ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.${REGION}.amazonaws.com/${IMAGE_NAME}:1.0"
----

== Test the image

[source, shell]
----
echo "... test the image ..."
podman pull "${NEW_TAG}"
podman image inspect "${NEW_TAG}" | grep Arch
podman run -d -p 8080:8080 "${NEW_TAG}"
